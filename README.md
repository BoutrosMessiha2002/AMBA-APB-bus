This project also contains VIVADO snippets for FPGA implementation, will do the ASIC flow on it in 1 week using Synopsys tools from RTL to GDS file generation.
NOTE: this is a simplified version of APB, write and read transactions whether burst or not, will work on adding error detection techniques later.
